"""Tests for rules_dispatcher.py — registry reachability, token budget, fail-open.

Written 2026-08-17 (audit gap 6) against the ALREADY-CORRECTED dispatcher
(remediation groups A-E applied), so the pre-fix bugs are never fossilised as
expected behaviour.

Two invariants this file exists to protect:
  1. Every alias in `_REGISTRY` is reachable by some real tool call AND points
     at a file that exists (the `routing.md` / `performance.md` class of bug,
     in both directions).
  2. The token budget quoted in the dispatcher docstring, `DYNAMIC.md` and
     `02_hooks_and_permissions.md` matches what `token_estimate()` actually
     returns today.
