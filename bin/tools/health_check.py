"""DQIII8 daily health check — score 0-100, alert via notify if < 70.

Checks (weights):
  DB integrity ok ............ 30
  unresolved errors (7d) ..... 25  (0 → full; >=20 → 0; linear between)
  telemetry alive (7d) ....... 25  (share of amplification rows with confidence > 0)
  disk free >= 15% ............ 10
  history db owner-only ...... 10
Penalty:
  hook telemetry stale ...... floor score at 55 (no agent_actions row in 48h
                                    while amplification_log shows 7d activity)
Separately, unscored: alerts if bin/monitoring/health_watchdog.py's own
heartbeat (var/watchdog_heartbeat) is missing or >24h stale — the two rails'
mutual dead-man's-switch.
Writes JSON to database/audit_reports/health_<date>_<HHMM>.json (one file per
run — never overwritten, so a wrong/stale run stays visible instead of being
silently replaced by the next run's numbers) plus health_latest.json (copy of
the most recent run, for callers that just want "now").
Exit code 0 always (cron-safe); alerting is the signal.
