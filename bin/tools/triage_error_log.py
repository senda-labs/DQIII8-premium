"""Triage the error_log backlog of expected free-tier fallback cascades.

~92% of unresolved error_log rows (openrouter_wrapperError/ESCALATION/nimError/
openrouterError/githubError/groqError/pollinationsError) are the FREE-tier
fallback chain (C→B→B+→B++, see CLAUDE.md Routing Tiers) doing exactly what
it's designed to do when one free provider is briefly unavailable — not
incidents. Nothing ever marks them resolved, and purge_transient_errors.py
only deletes rows with severity='transient' AND resolved=1, so they never
even become eligible for purge; they just accumulate forever.

anthropicError is intentionally EXCLUDED from the whitelist even though it
matches the same message shape — Anthropic is a paid tier (Tier A/S), not a
free-tier fallback rung, so an anthropicError is more likely a real billing/
OAuth incident and auto-resolving it could mask one.

Sets BOTH resolved=1 AND severity='transient' on matched rows (not resolved
alone) — that's what purge_transient_errors.py's WHERE clause requires to
actually reclaim them later; setting only resolved=1 would leave
'operational'-severity rows permanently ineligible for purge.

Correlation (Opus red-team review, 2026-08-13, P1-2): a whitelist match alone
can't distinguish "rung 2 failed, rung 3 answered" from "the whole free tier
is down" — both write the identical message shape, and a total-chain failure
(openrouter_wrapper.py's `sys.exit(1)` path) writes nothing to error_log at
all. So a genuine multi-day outage of the whole free tier would sail through
this script unresolved-then-purged, invisible to health_check.py. Rows that
carry an action_id are only auto-resolved if agent_actions shows a *successful*
row in the same session within CORRELATION_WINDOW_MIN of the error — i.e. the
cascade the error belongs to actually recovered. Rows with no action_id can't
be correlated (mostly older backlog) and fall back to whitelist-only, same as
before. As a second, cheaper safety net independent of correlation: the daily
matched count is compared against a rolling history file, and an anomalous
spike still alerts even for the uncorrelatable rows.

Correlation tightened (Opus red-team review of the above, 2026-08-13, round 2
P1-1): session_id alone was too coarse — `session_id='cli'` is a shared bucket
across unrelated invocations (1000+ agent_actions rows), and a long CLI
session logs successful Reads/Edits constantly regardless of whether the
*specific failing agent* recovered, so "any successful action in this
session" matched ~99% of candidates and would have papered over a real
outage. The successful sibling must now also match error_log.agent_name (the
actual failing component), and `session_id='cli'` is excluded from the
session-window fallback entirely — a shared-bucket session can never supply
correlation evidence, so its rows are always held for review.

Held-rows disposition (Opus red-team review, 2026-08-13, round 3 P1-2): the
cli-bucket exclusion above is correct but a held row is never re-evaluated —
it's still resolved=0 next run, so it reappears in `held_ids` every day
forever. Two consequences, both fixed here: (1) `_check_spike` compared a
monotonically growing cumulative held count against its own rolling median,
so the alert threshold asymptotically became unreachable (quantified live:
~59/day held, spike threshold needs an ~885-row single-day burst after just
30 days of accumulation) — fixed by diffing against the previous run's held
id set (`HELD_STATE_FILE`) so the spike check sees only *newly*-held rows
per run, a real daily rate. (2) held rows that still have no correlation
evidence after HELD_REVIEW_DAYS are auto-resolved with a distinct
resolution note (not `severity='transient'`, so purge_transient_errors.py
never deletes them — the audit trail survives) instead of accumulating in
`error_log` without bound.

Round 3's fix above had two of its own regressions, both fixed here (Opus
red-team review, 2026-08-13, round 5): (1) the age-out UPDATE never actually
set a non-'transient' severity — rows are inserted with severity='transient'
from day one (openrouter_wrapper.py), so the "audit trail survives purge"
claim was false the moment it was written; the UPDATE now sets
severity='aged_review' explicitly. (2) `_check_spike`'s `median > 0` guard,
harmless against the old ever-growing cumulative series, is fatal against
the new rate series: a 14-entry rolling median of a mostly-zero real series
is itself 0 almost always, permanently blocking the alert (replayed against
135 days of real data: 0 alerts fired, 6 real bursts up to 479/day
suppressed) — fixed by dropping the `median > 0` requirement so the
multiplier check alone gates the alert (round 6 review: with the outer
`newly_held >= SPIKE_MIN_HELD` gate already in place, `newly_held > median *
SPIKE_MULTIPLIER` is trivially true whenever median is 0, so no extra
zero-baseline clause is needed — brute-forced over median∈[0,9] x
newly_held∈[10,60) with zero divergence). Known residual (P3, not yet
reproduced on real data): a strictly periodic pattern like [0,0,12]*N can
keep the rolling median at/near 0 indefinitely, over-alerting on a routine
rhythm rather than a real spike — revisit with a mean-based or non-zero
baseline if this shows up live. (3) age-out is
now also gated on the row having appeared in a *previous* run's held
snapshot — a row backfilled by reconcile_errors.py with an old historical
timestamp was getting aged out on the very first triage run that ever saw
it, before it had been held for review even once.

Usage:
    python3 bin/tools/triage_error_log.py --dry-run   # show counts, no writes
    python3 bin/tools/triage_error_log.py --apply      # perform the UPDATE
Back up the DB first (bin/tools/db_backup.sh) — this is a bulk UPDATE.
