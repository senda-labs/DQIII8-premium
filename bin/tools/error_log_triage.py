"""Mark already-understood error_log categories as resolved.

Root-cause fix for the 2026-08-21 disaster-scenario sweep's "89 unresolved
error_log rows, no process ever closes the loop" finding: error_log grows
without bound because nothing ever revisits a row once its cause is
understood and accepted. This script is the reusable, idempotent mechanism
for that -- not a one-off UPDATE -- so the next already-explained category
(e.g. a future documented directive change) has a place to register a
pattern instead of silently accumulating in the backlog again.

Deliberately conservative: only resolves rows matching a hand-reviewed
pattern tied to a specific, cited, standing decision -- never a blanket
"mark everything resolved" pass. Run manually; not wired into any hook.
