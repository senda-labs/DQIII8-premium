"""Validate .claude/settings.json's hooks block.

Mitigation for the confirmed SPOF: Claude Code's own schema nests every hook
event (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, ...) under a single top-level
`hooks` key in one file — a malformed edit or a dangling script path anywhere
in it can silently take down all hook-driven telemetry (agent_actions,
error_log) with no error at commit time. This script can't split the schema
(Claude Code owns it), so it makes a break *detectable* instead: valid JSON +
every referenced hook script actually exists. It does NOT check executability
(most commands are invoked as `bash run.sh <script>` or `python3 <script>`,
where the interpreter reads the file regardless of the x-bit, so an x-bit
check would be noise, not signal).

A path outside the repo root (e.g. a globally-installed npm hook) is reported
as a WARNING, not a hard failure: treating it as fatal would couple every
commit in this repo to the lifecycle of an out-of-repo package (an `npm -g`
prune or Node upgrade can relocate it with no DQIII8 change at all), and the
pre-commit caller exits 1 only on `problems`, not `warnings`.

Usage:
    python3 bin/tools/validate_hooks_config.py [--settings PATH]
Exit code 0 = valid, 1 = invalid (JSON error or missing in-repo script).
